# Scope of SEDAP Express
 
SEDAP Express is an exceptionally fast path to integrate new applications, sensors, effectors or other similar things into the ecosystem of MESE (Military Expandable Software Environment). That's why it is intentionally kept simple and offers several technical ways of communication. Of course, this results in limitations, but in most cases where quick and easy integration is required, these are negligible. If increased demands arise later on, the “bigger” SEDAP API respectiveSEDAP-Express is an exceptionally fast path to integrate new applications, sensors, effectors or other similar things into the ecosystem of MESE.
