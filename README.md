# Readme of SEDAP-Express
 
## Scope

SEDAP-Express is an exceptionally fast path to integrate new applications, sensors, effectors or other similar things into the ecosystem of MESE (Military Expandable Software Environment). That's why it is intentionally kept simple and offers several technical ways of communication. Of course, this results in limitations, but in most cases where quick and easy integration is required, these are negligible. If increased demands arise later on, the “bigger” SEDAP API respective MESE interface can be used if necessary.

SEDAP-Express is licensed under the “Simplified BSD License” (BSD-2-Clause). Therefore, there should be no problems using SEDAP-Express in commercial or non-commercial projects or integrating parts of the SEDAP-Express framework.
